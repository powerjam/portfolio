    <!-- ADD INFO ABOUT DANCING -->
    <p>I learned web developing at a young age.  At age 10, I was creating websites with Frontpage (which doesn't even exist now apparently).  By the time I was 12, I was teaching myself -- with some guidance from my big brother -- to write HTML and CSS by hand in a very basic text editor (Notepad). I believe learning HTML and CSS, alongside Adobe Photoshop, as a hobby has instilledin me the skills of not only how to code, but also problem solving.</p>

    <p>My work experience has included a variety of areas, and it's reflective of my schooling and interests.  I've found myself to be both left and right-brained, i.e., logical and creative. So while I love a good process flow diagram and gaining an understanding of the big picture or how something works, I also have a huge curiosity of people and art. By people, I mean things like sociology and psychology.  Thus I think the career path that I'm on as a User Experience Designer is a great fit, since I can solve problems that users have, all-the-while being empathetic to their issues.</p>
    
    <p>What I focused learning during my undergrad includes Business, Information Systems, Human Resource Management, and a Diversity Minor.  Clearly that's a good jumble of courses.  But all of the above fascinated me, and if anything, I wish I had taken more sociology and psychology classes.</p>
    
    <p>In my career after college, I've held roles either formally or informally as an IT Auditor, Risk &amp; Compliance Consultant, Project Coordinator, Project Manager, Systems/Functional Analyst, and a Prodct Owner. Today, I'm a User Experience Designer, learning as I go, and I love every bit of it.</p>
