      <h2>About</h2>
      
     <p>My name is Jamie Powers Do (pronounced like doe, a female deer).<img src="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/81/8109fafbacf80ee1564090f14691430935821f6918d1d9894389fd02e06dcec1.jpg" align="right" width="250" style="padding-left: 10px;"></p>

      <p>I grew up in the greater Seattle area.  I continue to live here for its lush landscapes, calm weather, and it being a tech hub.</p>

      <p>I signed up for this course given the relevancy to my current job. And while I learned web design as a hobby growing up, I am not up to speed on the latest front end development technologies.</p>

      <a name="education"></a>
      <h2>Education</h2>

      <p>I received both my undergrad and master's at the University of Washington - Seattle. My BA is in Business Administration from the Foster School of Business, with a double concentration in Information Systems and Human Resource Management (yes, HR is an actual major at UW).  I also got a minor in Diversity, which included some of the most interesting courses I've ever taken, observing minority-majority relations of different races, genders, etc.</p>

      <p>After a few years of work, I obtained my MS in Information Systems. Don't ask me what I learned! I mostly enrolled because Boeing has a generous educational benefit.</p>

      <a name="work"></a>
      <h2>Work</h2>

      <p>When I graduated, I went straight into a Big 4 firm in IT audit/risk/compliance/whatever you want to call it. I was essentially an external auditor; the kind of person most workers hate. I learned quickly that it was not the right career fit for me.</p>

      <p>After a couple of years in IT compliance, I accepted a role at Boeing as a Systems Analyst. I've only been there 2.5 years, but I've had a few roles since I joined: Functional Analyst, Product Owner, and now UX Designer.</p>

      <p>I really enjoy what I'm doing currently as UX Designer, which I'm still learning a lot as I go. We are working on a maintenance data delivery project where we are completely redesigning current systems into an entirely new website. I hope this certificate program will come in handy since we want our website to be modern and responsive for mobile access.</p>
